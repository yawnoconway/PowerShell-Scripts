.Synopsis
Terminate-UserObject is used to secure terminated employees user objects.

.Description
Terminate-UserObject was written to accomdate an AD Forest infrastructure and uses Get-ADForest to enumerate the domains available.
It will validate a user for termination from any domain in the forest and accommodates user objects that have a 
manager in another domain.  This script has been tested in an AD Forest with three domains and approximately
900 User Objects. Results may vary with larger scale AD Forests. Script supports MFA or non-MFA MS Online 
and Exchange Online connectivity using the -MFA switch.

Actions:

    Disable user object
    Remove user object from all groups
    Clear user object attributes
    Set user object description to termination date
    Set Out of Office messages
    Set delegate authority on the mailbox to terminated employee's manager
    Migrate regular mailbox to shared mailbox
    Removes Office 365 Licenses
    Hide user object in the GAL
    Move user object to the "Terminated" OU (NOTE: OU must be at the root of the AD domain and named "Terminated")

.Parameter TargetUser
User Logon Name of User-Object to be terminated

.Parameter Delegate
Alternate delegate User-Object for mailbox and out of office replies (Optional)

.Parameter MFA
Required if using multi-factor authentication with MS Online or Exchange Online

.Example
Terminate-UserObject -TargetUser Minnie.Mouse

NOTE: Will request credentials twice for login to MS Online and Exchange Online with MFA

Output:
